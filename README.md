This is a personal portfolio website showcasing work in Organic Agriculture, Sustainable Innovation, and Research.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

I have already installed Git and initialized your local repository.

### Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub
1.  Log in to [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
3.  Name it `portfolio-website` (or `rinzin-portfolio`).
4.  Make sure it is **Public**.
5.  **Do not** check "Add a README", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license" (we already have files).
6.  Click **Create repository**.

### Step 2: Push your code
Copy the commands shown on the GitHub page under "…or push an existing repository from the command line". They will look like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/portfolio-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** If the `git` command doesn't work in your terminal yet, please **restart VS Code** to recognize the new installation.

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1.  Go to your repository **Settings** tab.
2.  Click **Pages** in the left sidebar.
3.  Under **Build and deployment** > **Branch**, select `main` and click **Save**.
4.  Your site will be live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/portfolio-website/` in a few minutes.
